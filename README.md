##  Projects

- **Field Service Security Systems Simulator**  

  Designed and simulated enterprise-grade security systems using Bosch BIS, BVMS, and Configuration Manager‚Äîintegrating video surveillance, access control, and alarms into a unified     
  platform with zero hardware.

  Engineered end-to-end solutions** with AutoCAD, SQL Server, and BIS tools, delivering real-time automation, compliance auditing, and scalable infrastructure trusted in mission-critical 
  environments.

  Developed a Python tool to simulate service issue intake, dispatch, and performance tracking for security systems. Created audit reports, site transfer checklists, and tracked SLAs for   resolution times.  
  _Tech: Python, CSV, Markdown_

- **Raspberry Pi Surveillance System**  
  Built a motion detection-based surveillance system using Raspberry Pi, integrating camera setup and automated alerts for security monitoring.  
  _Tech: Raspberry Pi, Python, Motion Detection Software_

- **Campus Wi-Fi Deployment**  
  Deployed secure Wi-Fi for 100+ users as part of an internship with Duke Developers. Configured routers, managed subnets, and monitored usage.

- **Log Parsing Automation**  
  Created Python scripts to extract and analyze system logs for suspicious activities. Resulted in 40% faster incident review.

- **AI Threat Detection System**  
  Developed an AI-based threat detection system that analyzes network and system data to identify potential security breaches in real-time. Used machine learning to reduce false positives and integrated alerting for immediate response.  
  _Tech: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SIEM tools_
