  Networking: TCP/IP, routing, DNS, DHCP, wireless config
  Tools: Wireshark, Splunk, Kali Linux, Cisco Packet Tracer
  Languages: Python (strong), Bash (intermediate), Java (basic)
  Systems: Windows Server, Linux, Raspberry Pi

  

##  Projects

Please Check my public repository to see my open sample projects

#Field Service Security Systems Simulator
Developed a Python tool to simulate service issue intake, dispatch, and performance tracking for security systems. Created audit reports, site transfer checklists, and tracked SLAs for resolution times.
Technologies: Python, CSV, Markdown

#Raspberry Pi Surveillance System
Built a motion detection-based surveillance system using Raspberry Pi, integrating camera setup and automated alerts for security monitoring.
Technologies: Raspberry Pi, Python, Motion Detection Software

### Campus Wi Fi Deployment
  Deployed secure Wi Fi for 100+ users as part of an internship with Duke Developers.
  Configured routers, managed subnets, and monitored usage.

###  Log Parsing Automation
  Created Python scripts to extract and analyze system logs for suspicious activities.
  Resulted in 40% faster incident review.
  
###AI Threat Detection System
Developed an AI-based threat detection system that analyzes network and system data to identify potential security breaches in real-time. Leveraged machine learning models to classify suspicious activities and reduce false positives. Integrated alerting mechanisms for immediate response.
Tech: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SIEM tools

## ðŸ”¹ Experience

###  Network Intern â€“ Duke Developers
Spring 2024

 Installed and configured wireless systems for campus network
 Managed physical setup and team coordination

Supported Tier 1â€“3 network operations by provisioning, implementing, and validating networking services. Managed enterprise network infrastructures using tools like SolarWinds, OpManager, Ansible, NetBox, and cloud-based solutions. Worked extensively with Layer 2/3 protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP, VLANs, VRRP, EVPN-VXLAN) and performed infrastructure cabling in virtualized environments.

Developed automation scripts using Python, Bash, and Terraform to enhance deployment and monitoring. Demonstrated strong skills in managing multi-vendor environments (Juniper, Arista, Cisco) and configuring firewalls (Juniper SRX, Palo Alto), including VPNs, URL filtering, and IDS/IPS.

Used tools like Wireshark, Splunk, SNMP, NetFlow, and RADIUS for diagnostics, monitoring, and log analysis to ensure network performance and security.
